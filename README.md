# INF224 ‐ Travaux Pratiques
## Author
Castaneda Medina Laura Manuela

## Overview
The project comprises two stages across different programming languages and frameworks, emphasizing object‐oriented programming and GUI development:

1. C++ Object‐Oriented Programming
2. Java Swing Interface Development

Together, these stages aim to teach comprehensive software development skills, from backend logic in C++ to frontend GUI development in Java Swing, culminating in a complete system for multimedia management and display.

## Directory Structure
- Castaneda_Medina__Laura_Manuela/: Main project directory.
-   cpp/: Contains all C++ related files, including source code and Makefile.
-   swing/: Contains all Java Swing related files, including source code and Makefile.

## C++ Component
This stage involves creating a multimedia set‐top box software prototype, focusing on object‐oriented design principles in C++. Base and derived classes where develop for multimedia objects ﴾like photos, videos, and films﴿, implement testing programs, and handle multimedia content effectively.

### Compilation and Execution
Navigate to the cpp/ directory and run make run to compile and execute the C++ program.

## Java Swing Component
The second stage extends the project into Java, where a graphical user interface ﴾GUI﴿ was created using Java Swing. This GUI is designed to interact with the previously developed C++ software, allowing for multimedia object management and playback. This stage includes creating the main window with interactive elements,
adding menu bars and tool bars, and establishing client‐server communication for multimedia object retrieval and playback.

### Compilation and Execution
Navigate to the swing/ directory and run make run to compile and execute the Java Swing program.

## Makefile
Both the C++ and Java Swing components include a Makefile for easy compilation and execution. Ensure you have the necessary compilers and JDK installed on your system.

## Code Documentation
The code is documented using Doxygen. Refer to the generated documentation ﴾Documentation.pdf﴿ for a detailed overview of the codebase.
